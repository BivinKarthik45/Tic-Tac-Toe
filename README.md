# Tic-Tac-Toe Java Swing Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java using the Swing GUI toolkit. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid to try and get three in a row.

## Getting Started

To run the game, you need to have Java installed on your system.

## How to Play

- The game starts with "X" being the first player.
- Click on any empty square to place your mark (either "X" or "O").
- The game alternates between "X" and "O" until one player wins or the board is filled.
- A player wins by getting three of their marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- If all squares are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a tie.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface using Java Swing.
- Visual indication of the current player's turn.
- End-of-game messages for win, tie, or game over.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance the graphics with icons for X and O instead of plain text.
- Implement a reset button to start a new game after the current game ends.
- Add error handling for boundary cases and unexpected input.
- Allow players to customize their names and symbols.
- Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
